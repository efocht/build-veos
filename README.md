# build-veos

Set of little helpers for building veos, ve_drv-kmod, vp-kmod, libved, veoffload, veoffload-veorun from a repository.

You might need to adjust or set the env variables VERSION and RELEASE, either outside the helper scripts, or inside.

Building these packages needs some prerequisite packages installed. A helper doing just that will be added in near future. Until then you'll have to resolve them one by one...
